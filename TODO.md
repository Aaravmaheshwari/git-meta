# Various things TODO:
- obiously, add more commands
- move validation logic into the command modules
- much more extensive command validation: I do not ever want to see a script
  stack due to knowable error conditions (e.g., invalid branch name)
- elmininate dependencies on static information (e.g., CWD) from utility
  components
- write unit tests
- turn this into a proper NPM module and doc dependencies
